## BikeShare Project

**This project is a set of functions that allow me to do some analysis of bike share data in Chicago, Washington DC and New York City.**

**BikeShare data is based on the rented bikes that are available on these cities, the data includes things like, the origin and destination stations of the bikes, the days the bikes were rented and some information about the users of the bike**

**The analysis is done with the python libraries pandas, numpy and time**
